# Project Guidelines

## Writing Style

When writing any text for this project (code comments, documentation, commit messages, etc.), follow these rules:

### General Principles
- Be direct and concise
- Avoid flowery language or excessive enthusiasm
- Write like a professional developer, not a marketing team
- Focus on facts and clarity over style

### Specific Rules

**DO NOT use:**
- Emojis (🚀, ✅, 🎉, etc.)
- Exclamation marks (unless absolutely necessary for warnings)
- Superlatives ("amazing", "awesome", "incredible")
- Marketing speak ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Filler words ("simply", "just", "easily")

**DO use:**
- Plain, technical language
- Active voice
- Complete sentences
- Specific, measurable descriptions
- Standard technical terminology

### Examples

**Bad:**
```
🚀 Amazing new feature! Simply run this command and you're all set! 🎉
```

**Good:**
```
New feature added. Run this command to configure.
```

**Bad:**
```
This incredible function will automatically handle all your data processing needs!
```

**Good:**
```
This function processes incoming data and returns formatted results.
```

## Code Comments

Keep comments minimal and technical:
- Explain WHY, not WHAT (code should be self-documenting)
- Use standard format: `// Description` or `/* Description */`
- Avoid personal opinions or subjective statements

## Documentation

- Use clear headings and structure
- Provide concrete examples
- List requirements and dependencies
- Include error handling information
- Write installation steps in numbered lists

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed
- Change 1
- Change 2
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## README

Structure:
1. Project description (1-2 sentences)
2. Features (bulleted list)
3. Tech stack (simple list)
4. Installation (clear steps)
5. Usage
6. API documentation
7. Deployment
8. License

Avoid:
- Long introductions
- Marketing language
- Testimonials or quotes
- Unnecessary sections

## User-facing Text

For UI elements and messages:
- Keep labels short (2-3 words max)
- Use title case for buttons
- Use sentence case for descriptions
- Provide clear error messages with solutions
- Avoid humor or casual language in production

Remember: Professional, technical, and direct communication is the goal.
